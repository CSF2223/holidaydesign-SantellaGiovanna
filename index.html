               <p class="story">The opposite of Santa. While Santa delivers presents to all the "nice kids", Krampus' punishes the "naughty kids". He typically will scare them with his terrifying looks but if they are very bad he will throw them in his sack. People in Austria will dress up as him to scare the children in thier neighborhoods.</p>

                <p class="story">In Scandinavia it is believed that Santa rides a goat to deliver presents instead of having reindeer pull his sleigh. This is why you will often find many ornaments with goats on them in Scandinavia. </p>
